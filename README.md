    Set the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file or through your system's environment settings.

6.  **Run the development server:**

    - **Use strong, unique passwords:** Encourage users to create strong passwords and avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.
- **Implement input validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Protect against CSRF attacks:** Use CSRF tokens in your forms to prevent cross-site request forgery.
- **Secure your database:** Protect your database by using strong passwords, limiting access, and keeping your database software up to date.
- **Regularly update dependencies:** Keep your application's dependencies up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
- **Use HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
- **Sanitize user inputs:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent script injection attacks.
